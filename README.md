# The-man-with-the-top-hat

"I shall grant you</br>
three wishes,</br>
no more than that."</br>
</br>
Said the man that</br>
wears the top hat.</br>
</br>
"Power will it be?</br>
Or perhaps the same wish,</br>
that king Midas did..."</br>
</br>
"Riches I do not desire,</br>
but what i need,</br>
a pair of eyes so deep,</br>
that people's soul I may see"</br>
</br>
"It has been granted.</br>
Sir, may I suggest?</br>
Inmortality or wings,</br>
choice is yours my friend."</br>
</br>
"No thanks,</br>
good suggestions tho,</br>
I would have said that in the past,</br>
what i want now is,</br>
i mind that</br>
the physical barrier can surpass"</br>
</br>
"With that, you have one left,</br>
what will it be your dessert?</br>
</br>
"For my last wish</br>
it'll be</br>
a powerful soul</br>
unstoppable,</br>
i'll explain,</br>
so demons like you,</br>
will never take it to hell"</br>
</br>
"I'll bow to you mister,</br>
you beat me at my game,</br>
I guess,you already know my name"</br>
